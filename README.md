# A copilot for creating cryptic crosswords. 

Computers should help us, not replace us. Setterbot is designed to help you construct cryptic crosswords, by finding patterns of sub-words, anagrams and nested words - taking over the mechanical parts, setting you up to take over with the creative flair that only a human can provide. 

## What it does: 

Searches possible words for each space in a crossword. 
Finds: 
-   Double definitions.
-   Single-word and compound anagrams.
-   Containers and charades.
-   Groups of words, with that word hidden inside. 


## Status: 

Certainly still in alpha, and porting from vanilla JS to Svelte & TS. 
- Complete porting old systems.
- Add loading other dictionaries.
- Add customisation of grid layout.
