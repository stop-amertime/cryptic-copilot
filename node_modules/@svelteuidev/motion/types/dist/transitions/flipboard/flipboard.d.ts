 * The flipboard transition that displays text with a glitch like effect. Just like every other transition, it is triggered by an element entering or leaving the DOM as a result of a state change. If you attempt to use the flipboard transition on non text nodes, it will result in an error.

 * ```tsx
 * <div transition:flipboard>Will be typed out</div>
 * ```
 *
 * @param params Optional params to pass to the transition
