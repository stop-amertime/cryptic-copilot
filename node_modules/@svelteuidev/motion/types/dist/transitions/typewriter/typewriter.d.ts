/**
 * The typewriter transition will give your text a typed effect. Just like every other transition, it is triggered by an element entering or leaving the DOM as a result of a state change. If you attempt to use the typewriter transition on non text nodes, it will result in an error.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <div transition:typewriter>Will be typed out</div>
 * <div transition:typewriter={{speed: 0.3}}>Will be typed out slower</div>
 * <div transition:typewriter={{speed: 2.5}}>Will be typed out faster</div>
 * ```
 *
 * @param params Optional params to pass to the transition
 * @see https://svelteui.org/motion/typewriter
